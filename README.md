# Junior Calculator Assignment
My solution for a calculator application needed to assess my coding skills as required for a job application. The application is to perform mathematical operations based on an XML/JSON input sent via HTTP and answer back with a XML result file.

#  Calculator Application Service

A flexible calculator written in **C# (.NET 8)** that can process **XML** and **JSON** input to perform nested mathematical operations.  
It demonstrates **interfaces, inheritance, encapsulation, recursion,** and **test-driven development (TDD)** through a modular design.

## ðŸš€ Features
- Accepts XML and JSON via **HTTP POST** or direct method calls  
- Supports **nested operations** (recursive evaluation)  
- Built with **OOP principles** and **TDD**  
- Clean separation of parsing, operation logic, and evaluation  
- **unit and integration tests**
